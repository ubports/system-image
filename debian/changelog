    - Remove the previously deprecated ``--no-reboot`` command line option.
    - LP: #1508081 - Add support for temporarily overriding the wifi-only
      setting when using ubuntu-download-manager:
      + Added ``ForceAllowGSMDownload()`` method to the D-Bus API.
      + Added ``DownloadStarted`` D-Bus signal, which gets sent when the
        download for an update has begun.
      + Added ``--override-gsm`` flag to ``system-image-cli``.

system-image (3.0-0ubuntu2) wily; urgency=medium

  [ Barry Warsaw ]
  * New upstream release.
    - LP: #1374459 - Support a built-in PyCURL-based downloader in
      addition to the traditional ubuntu-download-manager (over D-BUS)
      downloader.  Auto-detects which downloader to use based on whether
      udm is available on the system bus, pycurl is importable, and the
      setting of the SYSTEMIMAGE_PYCURL environment variable.  Initial
      contribution by Michael Vogt.
    - LP: #1384859 - Support alternative machine-id files as fall backs if
      the D-Bus file does not exist.  Specifically, add systemd's
      /etc/machine-id to the list.  Initial contribution by Michael Vogt.
    - LP: #1373467 - Support multiple configuration files, as in a
      `config.d` directory.  Now, configuration files are named
      `NN_whatever.ini` where "NN" must be a numeric prefix.  Files are
      loaded in sorted numeric order, with later files overriding newer
      files.  Support for both the `client.ini` and `channel.ini` files has
      been removed.
    - The `[system]build_file` variable has been removed.  Build number
      information now must come from the `.ini` files, and last update
      date comes from the newest `.ini` file loaded.
    - The `-C` command line option now takes a path to the configuration
      directory.
    - LP: #1412698 - Reworked the checking and downloading locks/flags to
      so that they will work better with configuration reloading.
    - LP: #1377312 - Support for the `/etc/ubuntu-build` file has been
      removed.  The build number now comes from the configuration files.
    - LP: #1377184 - Move the `archive-master.tar.xz` file to
      `/usr/share/system-image` for better FHS compliance.
    - LP: #1381538 - Since devices do not always reboot to apply changes,
      the `[hooks]update` variable has been renamed to `[hooks]apply`.
    - LP: #1333414 - For testing purposes only, `system-image-cli` now
      supports an undocumented command line switch
      `--skip-gpg-verification`.  Originally given by Jani Monoses.
    - LP: #1417176 - A new D-Bus signal `Applied(bool)` is added, which is
      returned in response to the `ApplyUpdate()` asynchronous method
      call.  For devices which do not need to reboot in order to apply the
      update, this is the only signal you will get.  If your device needs
      to reboot you will also receive the `Rebooting(bool)` command as
      with earlier versions.  The semantics of the flag argument are the
      same in both cases, as are the race timing issues inherent in these
      signals.  See the `system-image-dbus(8)` manpage for details.
    - As part of LP: #1417176, the `--no-reboot` switch for
      `system-image-cli(1)` has been deprecated.  Use `--no-apply` instead
      (`-g` is still the shortcut).
    - LP: #1419027 - Support production factory resets.  `system-image-cli
      --production-reset` and a new D-Bus API method `ProductionReset()`
      are added.  Given by Ricardo Salveti.
    - LP: #1399687 - A new key, `target_version_detail` has been added to
      the dictionary returned by the `.Information()` D-Bus method.
    - LP: #1387719 - The `User-Agent` HTTP header now also includes device
      and channel names.
    - LP: #1423622 - Added `--progress` flag to `system-image-cli` for
      specifying methods for reporting progress.  Current available values
      are: `dots` (compatible with system-image 2.5), `logfile`
      (compatible with system-image 2.5's `--verbose` flag), and `json`
      for JSON records on stdout.
    - Support for the `SYSTEMIMAGE_DBUS_DAEMON_HUP_SLEEP_SECONDS` environment
      variable has been removed.
    - LP: #1448153 - Fix `system-image-cli --list-channels`.
  * d/rules:
    - Run both the cURL and UDM based tests.
    - Run tests with more verbosity.
    - Install the archive-master keyring files to /usr/share instead of
      /etc for better FHS compliance.  (LP: #1377184)
  * d/control:
    - Add python3-pycurl to Build-Depends.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6 with no other changes necessary.
    - system-image-common now depends on
      `ubuntu-download-manager | python3-pycurl` so that UDM doesn't need to
      be pulled in for snappy.  (LP: #1431696)
  * d/tests/control: Disable DEP-8 "smoketests" which try to access
    external resources.  This is now prohibited by policy for
    pocket-promotion tests.  (LP: #1457070)

      can now take an optional ":level" prefix which can be used to set
